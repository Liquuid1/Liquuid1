¡Perfecto! Con la información que me has proporcionado, aquí tienes una propuesta para tu README en GitHub:

    👋 Hi, I’m @Liquuid1
    👀 I’m interested in developing video games, learning new programming languages, and exploring innovative tech solutions.
    🌱 I’m currently learning how to create video games using Godot 4.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to game development and other software development areas where I can apply my skills in Pascal, Python, and GDScript.
    📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at [liquuidsoft@gmail.com] or connect with me on LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-z%C3%BA%C3%B1iga-7340b930a/].
    😄 Pronouns: He/Him
    ⚡ Fun fact: Before diving into the world of programming, I was a music teacher. Music and coding are both about creativity and structure, and I love blending the two in my projects!
